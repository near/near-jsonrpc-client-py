"""Raw bytes containing borsh-serialized `UniversalStateInit`.

This is the protocol's view of a state init, not a mere transport wrapper: the
account ID is SHA3-256 over exactly these bytes. The typed form is a decoded
*view* of them, used to install the state and to price the action, and it is
never re-serialized to derive an ID. Two encodings of the same logical value
are two different accounts, which is deliberate: canonical encoding cannot be
enforced end to end anyway, since contracts serialize their own nested state
inside the opaque storage values.

It also lets an immutable contract pass through a `UniversalStateInit` version it
predates: the bytes travel verbatim, so a version added after the contract was
compiled still works.

Borsh-serializing `RawStateInit` writes a 4-byte length prefix before the
bytes, which is how the `UniversalStateInit` action carries it as a field;
over serde the bytes are base64. Neither is what the account ID hashes: that
is `self.0` alone, never `borsh::to_vec(self)`."""
