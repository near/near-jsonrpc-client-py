    #   - Supply `block_height` within parent's `±window` (default 5).
    #   - Supply `shard_id`. Omit → all-shards enumeration until walker
    #     crosses `FromReceipt` hop, multiplying cold-read cost.
    #   - Don't widen `window` beyond indexer's accuracy; budget shared
    #     across full ancestry walk.

    # Receipt-id-only queries against periods with `save_receipt_to_tx`
    # disabled stay unsupported: column never written, no self-locating.
